# Movie Magic Stripboard Integration - Implementation Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¬ Project Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation roadmap for integrating Movie Magic-style stripboard scheduling capabilities into STRIPS Film Production Scheduler. The goal is to bridge detailed scene scheduling with the visual calendar interface, creating a hybrid system that serves both detailed production planning and high-level schedule visualization needs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### **Current Status**: Concept & Planning Phase
### **Total Timeline**: 26-32 weeks (6-8 months)
### **Complexity Level**: High (Major Feature Release)
### **Risk Level**: Medium (Well-planned, builds on existing foundation)

### **Key Innovation**: Expandable Calendar Rows
- Calendar maintains clean, familiar interface
- Each shoot day expands to reveal scene-by-scene breakdown
- Best of both worlds: overview + detail in same interface

## ðŸ’¡ Key Design Principles

1. **Preserve Existing Workflows**: All current functionality must remain intact
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: New features are additive, not replacement
3. **Performance First**: No degradation of current calendar performance
4. **Intuitive Expansion**: Scene details revealed naturally and smoothly
5. **Mobile Consideration**: Expandable interface works on all devices

## ðŸŽ¬ Vision Statement

**Goal**: Transform STRIPS from a calendar tool into the definitive film production scheduling platform by seamlessly integrating Movie Magic-style scene management with the existing visual calendar interface.

**Success Criteria**: Users can accomplish both high-level schedule management and detailed scene planning within the same intuitive interface, without sacrificing the simplicity that makes STRIPS powerful.
