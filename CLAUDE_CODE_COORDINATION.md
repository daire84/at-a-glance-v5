# Claude Code Implementation Coordination Guide

## üéØ PROJECT MISSION

Transform the Film Production Scheduler from a single-admin system into a **production-ready tool** that serves both **admin users** (1st ADs, Producers) and **crew members** (public access without accounts).

## üìö DOCUMENTATION OVERVIEW

This project includes 5 comprehensive implementation guides:

1. **`CLAUDE_CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md`** - You are here! üéØ
2. **`USER_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md`** - Phase 1 implementation üîê
3. **`PUBLIC_SHARING_GUIDE.md`** - Phase 2 implementation üåê
4. **`DATA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Safe data transition üîÑ
5. **`TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`** - Comprehensive verification üß™
6. **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Production deployment üöÄ

## ü§ñ CLAUDE CODE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Working with Claude Code

When you engage Claude Code for this project, use this approach:

**1. Context Loading**
```
Load all .md files into the project context and ask Claude Code to:
- Analyze current codebase structure
- Identify existing patterns and conventions
- Understand the Flask blueprint architecture
- Map current authentication system
- Review data storage patterns
```

**2. Incremental Implementation**
```
Do NOT attempt to implement everything at once. Follow this order:

Phase 1A: User Management Foundation (2-3 hours)
Phase 1B: Authentication Enhancement (2-3 hours)  
Phase 1C: Data Migration (1-2 hours)
Phase 2A: Access Code Generation (2-3 hours)
Phase 2B: Public Routes (2-3 hours)
Phase 2C: Public Interface (1-2 hours)
```

**3. Verification Points**
```
After each phase, run the relevant section of TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
Claude Code should verify:
- No existing functionality is broken
- New features work as designed
- Data integrity is maintained
- Security requirements are met
```

## üîÑ IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Data Safety Rules
1. **ALWAYS backup before migration** - Use `DATA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
2. **Test migration script** with sample data first
3. **Verify rollback procedure** works before production
4. **Preserve all existing data** during transition
5. **Maintain JSON file integrity** throughout process

### Code Quality Rules
1. **Follow existing patterns** - Don't introduce new paradigms
2. **Use same imports and structure** as current files
